# LAGOS - MY HOMETOWN HOMEPAGE

This page was built from scracth by me alone.

It shows a tourist guide page for Lagos State

I used HTML and CSS to develop this page.

1. I implemented flex box in all section of the page
2. Generated my color palette from the background picture in the Hero section of the page using colors.co
3. I used hover effect on my card at the bottom of the page
4. Used the Google font Spinnaker

## Supporting Scrimba

Since 2017, we have created over 20 free courses on Scrimba, and we're going to
continue launching free courses. But to pay our bills, we have to charge once
in a while. So if you've ever wanted to "give back" to Scrimba, you can do that by buying
	one of our paid courses

- [Become a professional React developer](https://scrimba.com/course/greact)
- [The Responsive Web Design Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/course/gresponsive)
- [The Ultimate JavaScript Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/course/gjavascript)

	It would also mean the world to us if you share the courses.  

Happy Coding!
